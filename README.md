# Budgethack 

#### Bureaucrats Team


This file is supposed to describe the project, but we can also use it to propose ideas and / or soluions to problems. Just in case, this is a markdown file so it uses a very simple syntax to format to HTML.


## ToDo

Local Government Area
Line graph for tax intake over time by Vic government

ABS data for Victoria population
Socio economic disadvantage indicator

Population by LGA for the map.
Income by LGA


## Ideas

1. for the plot at the bottom we can compare budget outlays per person per year with tax intake per person per year. This would be interesting because if the lines ever cross it indicates a possible transition from surplus to deficit (or vice versa). I will look for an example or mock one up. -- MJ
