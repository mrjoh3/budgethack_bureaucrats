The files in this repository belong to two aspects of the project. First there is the data processing files and second the final webpage. Both should work as they are once the repository is downloaded. I will make sure everything is fixed and ready to go within the next couple of days.


## Data Processing

Dataprocessing was all done using R and Rmarkdown. This was used to both clean data, prototype the final website and create the data structures needed for the final product.


## The Website

The website should run in your browser with only the `index.html` and `abs_sub.geojson` files along with the js folder all in the same directory.
